## 👀 What Is Titanfall 2 Wallhack?

Wallhack (also known as **ESP**, or Extra Sensory Perception) is a cheat that overlays enemy positions and important game objects directly onto your screen — even if they’re behind walls, above you, cloaked, or miles away.

No guessing. No sound-whoring. Just **real-time visibility** of every threat and target. It’s like running thermal vision 24/7.
